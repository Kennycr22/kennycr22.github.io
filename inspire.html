        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>Joey Wendle has been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember.I've played baseball for my entire life and I have always tried to model my game and playing style after Joey. Joey was overlooked his whole life for his size and unusual play style but that never stopped him from acheiving his dream. Although his on the field accomplishments are incredible it is who he is off the field that truly makes him my hero. Joey is a man of faith and sets a great example for kids everywhere. He is involved in charities and tuly loves being a part of something bigger than himself, and that is why he is my hero.</p>
